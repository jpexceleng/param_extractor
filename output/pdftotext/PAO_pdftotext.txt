   Alarms
 Discrete Logix Tag based alarms are defined for the following members.
 Member
 Alarm Name
 Description
 Sts_IOFault
 Alm_IOFault
 IO Failure.
 Raised when the Inp_IOFault input is true. Use this input to indicate to the i
nstruction that a 
connection with the module is in fault. This input also indicates if a module reports field power 
loss/no load/
short circuit is occurring for its I/O. If the I/O Fault is configured as a shed fault, 

the device is commanded Off and cannot 
be commanded to another state until reset. The 
alarm condition is not raised when in Virtual.
 Sts_DeviceFault
 Alm_DeviceFault
 Device Confirmed Failure.
 Raised when the Inp_DeviceFault input is true. The Device fault alarm condition is not raised 
when in V
irtual.
 Sts_Dev
 Alm_Dev
 Deviation alarm.
 Raised when the difference between desired device position and 
actual device position is 

greater than High limit or lower than Low limit., i.e. if the following is true:
 ((Val_CVOut
-Val_Pos) > Cfg_HiDevLim) OR ((Va
l_CVOut
-Val_Pos) < Cfg_LoDevLim)
 Sts_IntlkTrip
 Alm_IntlkTrip
 Interlock Trip alarm.
 Raised when an interl
ock not
-OK condition causes the device to transition from the On state or 
a pulsing state to the Off state.
 If interlocks are not bypassed, a bypassabl
e interlock or a non
-bypassable interlock not
-OK 
condition initiates an interlock trip. If interlocks are
 bypassed, only a non
-bypassable interlock 
not
-OK condition initiates an interlock trip.
 Mark the alarm as used or unused and set standard configurati
on members of 
the discrete Logix Tag based alarm. Access alarm elements using this format:
 PAOTag.@Alarms.AlarmName.AlarmElement
 The Program commands for each alarm enable users to Acknowledge, 
Suppress, Unsupress and Unshelve the Alarm. These commands are
 propagated to corresponding commands (ProgAck, ProgSuppress, 

ProgUnsupress, ProgUnshelve) 
of the tag
-based alarm.
 There are also Program commands that enable users to Acknowledge, Reset, 
Suppress and Unsuppress all alarms of the instruction or an alarm se
t at the 
same time.
