 Cfg_NoSubstPV
 BOOL
 Disables the maintenance substitution feature.
 0 = The Substitute PV Maintenance function is enabled, 
 1 = The Substitute PV M
aintenance function is disabled.
 When Cfg_NoSubstPV is 0, the commands MCmd_SubstPV and MCmd_InpPV are used to select the 

input PV or the substitute PV. Sts_SubstPV is set to 1 
when the substitute PV is selected.
 Default is false.
 Cfg_SubstTracksTarget
 BOOL 1 = The substitute PV tracks Inp_Target, 0 = The substitute PV is set by MSet_SubstPV.
 Default is false.

 BOOL
 1 = The state text is displayed in Normal state
, 0 = The state text is hidden in Normal state.
 Default is true.

ensuring that the status 

stays in each state a minimum time.

 441   Operation
 The Gate function provides the ability to raise an abnormal condition (alarm 
condition) when another condition is true. For example, a high vibration 
switch should only generate an alarm when the associated motor is runni
ng 
long enough
 to stabilize. The Inp_Gate input must be set to 1 (its default value) 
and the tag
-based alarm for Sts_TgtDisagree enabled for alarm to occur. The 
alarm will not occur until the Inp_Gate input has been set for the Gate Delay 
(Cfg_GateDly) tim
e. The alarm i
s generated when the Inp_PVData (process variable) input is 
different from the Inp_Target (target) input. The Target indicates the normal 
condition. For example, a flow switch should indicate flow when a pump is 
running and should not indicat
e flow when a 
pump is stopped. The pump run 
status is used as the Target input, and when the switch does not match the 

target (within the allotted time), the Alarm (Flow Loss / Switch Failure) is 
generated.
